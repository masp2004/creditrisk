The best place to start is how I got into the debt to begin with. It wasn't due to irresponsible spending on the pleasures of life.  One credit (@ $4900) card was used to help my mom, who was laid off over a year ago get her prescriptions.  They ran about $500 a month.  The other card (@ $3800) was at $5K and was opened to put new carpets in my mom's house because the other carpets had been in the house for over 30 years.  Was she supposed to help pay this off once she got a job?  Yes.  However, in this economy a job for someone in their mid 50's with good pay is hard to come by.  The final card (@ $950) is my one card that I use to get by, if I need to.  I don't have to include this card but since I asked for $10K I might as well pay that one off too... Please help me get out of this credit card debt!

I was recently married and carried with me baggage of debt into this new chapter of my life. I was laid off from my last pharmaceutical job in August of 2009 and spent 9 months looking for work. I remained in the restaurant industry during that time but it only allowed me to make ends meet...not get a grip on paying off my debt. <br/>I was recently hired in May of this year with Cephalon, a new pharmaceutical company. It has allowed me to get back on my feet again...but paying for my wedding as well as all my other bills again made it difficult to pay of my debt with my Wells Fargo card where the interest is horrible. I make my payments on time with all my cards and try to pay more than the minimum amount but it is not making any kind of  dent due to the fees. <br/>I would love to buy a house and make a family in about three years....right around where my debt would be payed off. <br/>A fresh start is just what I need....a new chapter by being debt free!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Fresh Start Loan,941xx,CA,11.92,0.0,Jan-1999,0.0,29.0,,7.0,0.0,18017.0,86.6,12.0,f,0.0,0.0,18667.85,18380.85,15000.0,3667.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,Nov-2013,546.78,,Nov-2013,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I admit to having been financially careless in the past, however I now realize that I must be financially responsible in order to live my life to the fullest.  I want to pay off my debt so that I have money to one day raise a family, support my parents, donate to charity, and live guilt free.  <br/><br/>I have been loyally making monthly credit card payments for the last 12 years.  Currently I am able to comfortably pay $300 a month in credit card payments, however only a little more than half of that actually goes to paying off my debt.  The rest simply goes to paying bank fees.  <br/><br/>I work full time as a Graphic Designer/Photographer at the same company for the last two years.  <br/><br/>Some of the steps I have made to take charge of my financial situation have been:<br/>1) Curbing my spending (I didn't buy the latest greatest new iPhone! I still have my old beaten down laptop of 4 years!).<br/>2) I try to bring my own lunch to work every day and eat in as much as I can.<br/>3) I write down everything I spend on and try to stay in a budget.<br/><br/>All I want is to pay off my debt as fast as possible!  Investing in me guarantees that your money will make interest, because I always make my monthly payments but this time they will be going to you rather than a giant bank with huge interest rates!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Refinancing my Credit Card Debt,112xx,NY,13.34,0.0,Oct-1996,0.0,,,10.0,0.0,10093.0,30.1,27.0,f,0.0,0.0,8687.49,8687.49,7800.0,887.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,Sep-2013,251.76,,Apr-2014,0.0,,1.0,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
